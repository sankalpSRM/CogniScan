# Alzheimer's Prediction App: Quick Start

## ðŸš€ How to Run the MLP Model API

1. **Install requirements:**
   ```bash
   pip install flask tensorflow numpy
   ```
2. **Run the API server:**
   ```bash
   python ml/serve_mlp_api.py
   ```
   This will start a server at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

3. **Send a prediction request:**
   - POST to `/predict` with JSON like:
     ```json
     {
       "behavioral_problems": 1,
       "memory_complaints": 1,
       "functional_assessment": 12.5,
       "adl": 8.0,
       "mmse": 27
     }
     ```
   - The response will be a prediction array.

4. **Connect your frontend:**
   - Make your web form send a POST request to `/predict` with the above JSON structure.
   - Display the result to the user.
